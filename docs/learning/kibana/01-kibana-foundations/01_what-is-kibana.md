## 🔄 Data Flow Example

Here's how data flows from source to visualization:

```
1. APPLICATION LOGS
   └── Raw log: "2024-01-15 10:30:00 ERROR Database connection failed"

2. DATA INGESTION (Filebeat/Logstash)
   └── Parsed: {
         "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
         "level": "ERROR",
         "message": "Database connection failed",
         "service": "web-app"
       }

3. ELASTICSEARCH STORAGE
   └── Indexed document searchable by all fields

4. KIBANA VISUALIZATION
   └── Line chart showing error rates over time
   └── Dashboard combining multiple service metrics
   └── Alert when error rate exceeds threshold
```
