Your field: api.response_duration_ms
Adjustment: Convert units if needed
```

**Metric Adjustments:**
```bash
# Business context adaptation
Template: Page views per hour
Your need: API calls per minute
Adjustment: Change time interval and field

Template: Revenue in USD
Your need: Revenue in EUR
Adjustment: Update currency format
```

### 2. **Design Customization**

- **Missing data**: Required fields not available
- **Data quality**: Inconsistent or inaccurate data
- **Volume issues**: Performance problems with large datasets

### Customization Problems
- **Over-customization**: Losing template benefits
- **Under-customization**: Not meeting specific needs
- **Design inconsistency**: Mixed styling approaches
- **Feature creep**: Adding unnecessary complexity

### User Adoption
- **Training gaps**: Users don't understand features
